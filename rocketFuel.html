<li>The interview question focused on system design</li>
<li>random permutation of a string, inversion pairs, random sample from a infinite data stream.</li>
<li>Implement postorder traversal - most people will use recursion, I did so. 2, Follow-up: Not to use recursion but use for/while loop. 3, write a function for the for/while loop to get the next pointer with the current pointer as the input.</li>
<li>Given a plot of land and $250,000, what can you do to maximize your revenue and what kinds of data would you look at to do so?</li>
<li>Implement LRU cache. Come up with the best you can. </li>
Implement a data structure which supports insert , delete getMedian operations. Come up with the best you can.   </li>
<li>Find the universal sink in a graph in O(Nodes) time complexity. The graph is given as an adjacency matrix.
<li>A Node which has incoming edge from all nodes and has no outgoing edge is called Universal sink.</li>
