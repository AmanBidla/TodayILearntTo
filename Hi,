Hi,

My name is Sreeprasad and I am passionate about technology.

I enjoy cultivating enjoyable experience for users through meaningful interaction.     I work on test first principle and love the transition of the Idea to Prototype to Testing to Products and then scaling to incredible levels.  

I strongly believe in JUnits test-driven development and have always tried to learn by designing and coding side projects. I love to work on new technologies and learn from creative developers and would love to interview at Oscar.

Thank you.
