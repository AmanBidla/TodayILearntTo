The one about API rate throttler, mentioned in one of the glassdoor posts.
use a queue+ Choose time granularity ... on incoming request try to consume balance... dequeue , replenish balance + enqueue new values. OR enqueue a time for incoming request while queue &lt; max , then on tick dequeue all times &gt; 1 minute ago.

Implement a rate limiter attribute/decoration/annotation on top of an API endpoint. caps to N requests per minute with a rolling window (implement from scratch / test / compiling + working code) 

Given a set of sudoku boards, determine whether a board is valid or not.  
Implement a timer using queue.  
A file contains strings like abcd 3.0 xyx 4.0 foobar 5.0 return random string but probability should be based on weighted average  
find the kth smallest element of a BST. What are the purposes of a heap.  
Some examples: isMatch(“aa”,”a”) ? false isMatch(“aa”,”aa”) ? true isMatch(“aaa”,”aa”) ? false isMatch(“aa”, “a*”) ? true isMatch(“aa”, “.*”) ? true isMatch(“ab”, “.*”) ? true isMatch(“aab”, “c*a*b”) ? true Write isMatch()

Implementing the substring method  

(Easier) You have a sorted array of integers. Find the element where the array index is equal to the value of the corresponding element. Or return that no such element exists.  
Harder) You have a dictionary of words. Create a matrix of letters such that each row of the matrix is a word and each column of the matrix is a word. Kind of like a very dense crossword puzzle.  
Search a target number in a Rotated Sorted Array.  

1. Say there are a bunch of records (either photos/news feed/videos) to be displayed as feed on a mobile app, how would you improve the performance of such an interface 2. Implement bus event design pattern  
Implement a map data structure using a binary search tree. It should have the functions Get, Set, and Size.  
Search and delete nodes in BST. Delete operation is pretty tricky and you should review that.  
How did you implement [trade secret system]?  
Given a restaurant menu and a budget, output all the possible ways to use up the budget.  
Lowest common ancestor in BST  

Pig Latin encoding..maybe he intended to ask decoding as well but I never got there  
How would you design a spreadsheet application?  
write code to print the matrix from outside to inside.  
Create a Json like object to representation and implement a flatten method to return string-&gt; string mapping. (implement from scratch / test / compiling + working code) {x:1, y:1, z:{a:1,b:2}} flattens to {x:1, y:1, z.a:1, z.b: 2} 

Implement an LRU cache.  
Reversing a linked list, Implementing a rate limiter for a web service.  

A classic permutation questions. Followed by the question if duplicates exist.  
Write a spreadsheet engine in the language of my choice.  
Implement boggle  

Using Object Oriented Design principles, design a method to check if a Sudoku board is valid (skeleton code was provided which was initially passed in through a 2-d array).
Given a list of words, find whether a new word is anagram of word in list.  
Design a price surge system, both at a high level and the architecture

Design an API for a service, then layout how much data your service will hold and how many machines it needs.
Given a regular expression pattern and a string, check to see if pattern matches the string.  
Design a distributed system for sorting of large files.  

1. Segment Tree; 2. How to diagnose latency in data center;  

Print all permutations of 3 pair of parens. ()()(), (()()), (())(),,,. etc  
Find the longest word in a grid of random letter, each consecutive letters has to be next to the previous one.
