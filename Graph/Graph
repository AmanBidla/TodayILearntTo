Graph

How to check if graph is acyclic 

1. undirected :
do dfs
If an edge leads to a node already visited then there is a back edge and there is a cycle


2. directed : 

 // do topological sort 
 // if indegree[i] !=0 after topological sort then not acyclic 
  

How to do DFS using 

1. recursive
2. non recursive

What is the difference between sparse and dense graph
 //A dense graph is a graph in which the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges. A graph with only a few edges, is a sparse graph.
