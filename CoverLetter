Dear Sir,

My name is Sreeprasad and I love to make sense of data. 

I enjoy to make data create value for the user. Data adds value by empowering users to make intelligent decision and I want to make experience enjoyable for user. I work on test first principle and love the transition of the Idea to Prototype to Testing to Products and then scaling to incredible levels. I strongly believe in JUnits test-driven development. I love to work on new technologies and learn from creative developers and would love to interview at DataStax.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Sreeprasad
